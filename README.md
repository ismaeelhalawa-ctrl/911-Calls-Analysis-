# 911 Calls Analysis
911 Emergency File: This file represents data on emergency calls received by response centers. The main question we are trying to answer here is: Are there specific times or areas where calls increase significantly? How can resource allocation be optimized according to these patterns? And what are the times when emergencies occur most often?
Analyzing this data is of great importance in providing historical insight and future forecasts.

Analyzing the 911 Calls:
<> To begin analyzing the file data, we first need to verify the validity of the information and its source, then read it.
<> We began by cleaning the data and categorizing emergency calls by type and time of occurrence using Pandas.
<> The data was segmented by time and location to understand the distribution.
<> We used the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to analyze the data to identify the most frequent times of emergency or crime incidents and the areas that needed more resources.

Analysis Results:
1) The results revealed that there are times when emergency calls are most frequent, particularly during the evenings and weekends.
2) Some areas showed a higher rate of emergency calls, indicating the need to enhance security resources.
3) The analysis also showed that the most frequent emergencies were medical emergencies.
